<h3> Introduction: </h3>

<p> The goal of this project is to construct a functioning alarm clock and to add features that may be relevant for the user. </p>

These features include:

- Turning off the LCD backlight.
- Preventing the device from being stuck on menu settings (if happened by accident).
- Removing the LED to simplify build, as the LCD is proven to be bright enough by itself.

Additional challenges for me were:

- Soldering the DS1037 RTC module. It was a challenge, an easier method would have been to purchase a DS3231.
- Power sources, how to maximize portability. 
- Learning the uses of the I2C protocol and drawing the modules used in Fritzing (namely Serial Interface Board Module 1602).
